# Satday Quiz 

* Make Sure that you submit your response as a code file [.py] file 
* If the answer is a number or sentence [say your conclusion of a test ], include that as a comment in the code file along with the code that you used to obtain the answer 
* Feel free to make use of any online resource 

Here it goes 

## Q1

consider data `bike_sharing` in the repo . Respond with your conclusions [and code if needed ] for the following 

1. Are the average number of rented bikes in first 7 days of months different significantly between first 6 months Vs last 6 months of the year ? [consider column `cnt`]
2. Find the average temperature [consider column `temp`] in the first quarter of the year . Has this changed significantly in the third quarter of the year ? 
3. Does it matter which weekday it is , when it comes to causally rented bikes ? [consider column `casual`]

## Q2

find all possible solutions of  system of these linear equations : 
$$
2x + 3y + 4z^2 = 23
\\ y^2 - x^2 = 3
$$
considering that sum and difference of x,y are strictly integers . Although you could solve the equations by hand , i would like you to share a python code which uses linear algebra [and matrices to represent ] to solve the resulting system(s) of equations . 

## Q3

Do weather situations affect bike renting behaviours . Show me visually . Consider columns [ temp , hum , windspeed and `cnt`]
